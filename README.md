# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for empty or invalid request bodies in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper validation and error handling for the incoming request body. If a client sends an empty or malformed JSON payload, the server will either log an error or silently fail, leading to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and appropriate error handling to gracefully manage invalid requests.  This includes checking if the request body exists and if it contains the expected data structure before processing it.  Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (like 400 Bad Request) is crucial for informing the client about the error.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Run `bug.js`.
2. Send a POST request to `/user` with an empty body or invalid JSON.
3. Observe the lack of explicit error handling and potential server-side issues.

## How to fix the bug

1. Run `bugSolution.js`.
2. Repeat the POST requests from step 2 above.
3. Observe the improved error handling and appropriate HTTP responses.
